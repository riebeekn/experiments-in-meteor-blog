Hello!  I'm Nick Riebeek, and 'Experiments in Meteor' is a blog focused on the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor Javascript Framework</a>.

I've been a professional software developer for over a decade, pretty much exclusively working with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_blank">.NET</a>.  

A few years ago I decided to do a simple side-project in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a>... not only was using Rails a ton of fun, but the experience turned out to really improve my understanding of Microsoft's MVC framework, I think it is safe to say <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> has been heavily influenced by Rails.  After my experience with Rails, I started to keep a closer eye on technologies outside the Microsoft stack.

One of the technologies that ended up catching my eye was Meteor.  I'm loving it so far and thought I would share some of the things I've learned.  I consider myself a 'tinkerer' at this point so most of the posts on 'Experiments with Meteor' will be in the beginner - intermediate range of ability.  If you've got a basic understanding of Meteor you should be good to go!
